This code constitutes the source code used for a project that compares the learning curves of various natural language processing (NLP) approaches for clinical text mining of pathology reports in glioblastoma patients. This source code can be used as an open-source NLP framewerk for medical text analysis. The link to the original publication can be found here [insert link]. This code is made publicly available to promote the transparency and reproducibility of computer code used for NLP in clinical research. Suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

Please contact me for any questions, comments, or suggestions related to the code.

Kind regards,
