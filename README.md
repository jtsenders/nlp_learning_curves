This code constitutes the source code of a project on natural language processing (NLP) utilized for medical text analysis. In this specific project, we compared the learning curve of various NLP approaches for classifying free-text pathology reports of glioblastoma patients. This source code can be used as an open-source NLP framework for clinical text mining. The link to the original publication can be found here [insert link]. This code is made publicly accessible to promote the transparency and reproducibility of computer code used for NLP in clinical research. Suggestions for improvement are very welcome.

Please contact me for any questions, comments, or suggestions related to the code.

Kind regards,
